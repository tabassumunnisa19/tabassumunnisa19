        <p>Life is a lot like Python. Sometimes it feels like you’ve just mastered one error, and another pops up—
        a wild <code>IndentationError</code> appears right when you thought things were smooth. Parenting? That’s the 
        never-ending <code>while True:</code> loop with surprise exceptions you never knew existed!</p>

        <p>But just like Python, life gives us libraries. Patience, resilience, love, and laughter—they make the 
        code of our days not just runnable, but beautiful. And when debugging both Python and life, 
        the golden rule remains: take a deep breath, print what matters, and keep going.</p>
